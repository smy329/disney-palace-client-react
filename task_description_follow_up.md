## **Main Requirements**

- **Extra Section:** Add two relevant sections. Try to make them attractive.

## **Optional (But Highly Recommended):**

1. Implement a JWT token in your routes.

<br/>

2. Add a spinner when the data is in a loading state. You can add a gif/jpg, use any package or customize it using CSS.

<br/>

3. **Interesting part:**

   > Each blog will contain a question, an answer, and a pin icon. You can display them however you want. When a user clicks on a pin icon, the pin icon will become blue (or any dark color), and the pinned blog will be shown on the homepage. However, if a user clicks on the already pinned blog, the blog will be unpinned, and that blog will not appear on the homepage. Make sure to make the pin icon white when the blog unpins.
   > <br/>
   > When a user is not logged in, the pin button is disabled.

<br/>

4. **Little Bit Advanced:** Add more toys for each sub-category. You can add pagination in your tab system.

<br/>

5. Add extra features of your own. This will help you in the future to differentiate your project from others.

### **What to submit:**

1. Your client-side code GitHub repository
2. Your server-side code GitHub repository
3. Your live website link
